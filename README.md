# PROJETO MACAÃ“ - Social Sciences Student Cooperative 
## Description
This repository contains the source code of the Macao website, a student cooperative in social sciences that I founded at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil. The website was developed to serve as a central platform for students of politics, sociology, and anthropology to join the Macao project, share knowledge of social sciences, and offer services to civil society.

## Technologies Used
+ Front-end: The main site was built using HTML and CSS to ensure a simple and effective user experience.<br>
+ <a href="https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website">Eleventy</a> :The blog, where students can publish articles, was developed using Eleventy, a static site generator. Eleventy simplifies creating static sites using various template languages; in this case, we're using the Nunjucks template language.
+ <a href="https://decapcms.org/">Decap CMS:</a> It is an interface for posting blog articles, facilitating access for future participants and writers who want to host their texts on the site.
+ <a href="https://form2channel.com/">Form2Channel Service</a>: On the contact page, I implemented the Form2Channel service, which allows anyone to easily submit forms and send them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This ensures that we can collect contact information in an organized and efficient manner.
